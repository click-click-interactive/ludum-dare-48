    text: "Just like last time, we can\u2019t see the key anywhere from here, it\u2019s
      probably inside. There are even more demons this time around -and they\u2019re
      so much bigger too- and I\u2019ve seen Soul Torches everywhere here as well,
      we need to be careful. You know what this means right ?"

      the soul torches, get the key, and come out. We\u2019ll hold here."
